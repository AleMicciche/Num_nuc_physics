# Overview

This repository contains the code and the results obtained by testing various effective potentials to describe the low energy behaviour of a given short range potential. The results obtain from the **`code.py`** are colleected in the folder:

*  **`Coulomb`**:
  for a Coulombic potential

*  **`true`**:
  for the chosen short range potential

*  **`eff_a_4`**:
  for an effective field theory up to order a^4. It contains subfolders for different values of a

*  **`eff_a_2`**:
  for an effective field theory up to order a^2. It contains subfolders for different values of a
